# 🧠 NeuroVoice - EEG-to-Speech Interface

## 🌟 What is NeuroVoice?

NeuroVoice is a **brain-computer interface** that translates brain signals (EEG) into spoken words. It's designed to help people who cannot speak (like locked-in syndrome patients) communicate through their thoughts.

> **Imagine thinking "HELP" and the computer speaks it aloud automatically!**

---

## 🎯 What Problem Does This Solve?

- **500,000+ people worldwide** cannot speak due to medical conditions
- Current communication methods are **slow and frustrating**
- NeuroVoice provides **instant, thought-to-speech communication**

## 🎮 How to Use the App

### Starting the Demo:
1. **Click "Start Live Demo"** in the left sidebar
2. Watch the **real-time brain wave display**
3. See the AI **predict words** from brain signals
4. Listen to the **computer-generated speech**

### What You'll See:
- **Left Side**: Live brain wave graph (like a hospital monitor)
- **Right Side**: AI predictions with confidence scores
- **Emergency Alerts**: Red warnings for "HELP" or "PAIN"

## 🔧 For Technical Users (Optional)

### Manual Installation via Command Line:
```bash
# 1. Navigate to project folder
cd path/to/NeuroVoice

# 2. Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Run the app
streamlit run app.py
```

### Required Python Packages:
- `streamlit` - Web interface
- `tensorflow` - AI brain
- `numpy`, `pandas` - Data processing
- `plotly` - Graphs and charts

## 🧩 How It Works (Simple Explanation)

### 1. **Brain Signal Detection**
- Simulated EEG headset reads brain waves
- Like a hospital brain monitor

### 2. **AI Understanding**
- Computer learns what different brain patterns mean
- Recognizes "YES", "NO", "HELP", etc.

### 3. **Speech Generation**
- Google's text-to-speech converts words to audio
- Computer speaks the predicted words

---

## 🎯 Demo Scenarios to Try

### Medical Emergency:
1. Start demo → AI detects "HELP" pattern
2. System shows **red emergency alert**
3. Computer speaks "HELP" aloud

### Basic Communication:
1. Start demo → AI detects "WATER" or "PAIN"
2. System shows prediction with confidence
3. Computer speaks the detected need

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Python not found"
**Solution**: Reinstall Python and check "Add to PATH"

### Problem: App won't start
**Solution**: 
1. Open Command Prompt/Terminal
2. Type `python --version` to check installation
3. Run `pip install streamlit` then `streamlit run app.py`

### Problem: Import errors
**Solution**: Run `install_requirements.bat` again
